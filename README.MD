The second project is NTUST Fundamentals of Computer Graphics which is focused on particle effects and texture mapping using GLSL Shaders, and is done within one and a half week

The project is about a fighter plane model that is equipped with various visual effects and animations such as:
- Simple Geometric Particle Effect (Tail Smoke)
- 2D Billboarding Particle with Particle Sheets (Smoke, Explosion, Fire, Aura)
- Water Plane (Reflection and Refraction FBO Render + Project Texture Mapping, blue color tint, DUDV Mapping, Normal Mapping, Fresnel Effect, Shadow Mapping)
- Environment Mapping (Cubemap with Reflection + Refraction)
- Screen Mozaic (Square, Triangle, Polygon)
- Shader Material (Molten Rock Plane Texture with Normal mapping)
- Toon Shader
- Motion Blur with Offscreen Render and mixing FBO Data between render

Again, 3D Modelling Applications such as Blender and Maya were not used since they are forbidden as stated by the project rule.
